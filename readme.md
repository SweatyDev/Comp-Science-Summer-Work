# Heya, Sir! Happy New Term!

Hope you've had a wonderful break. But, now you're stuck with me for another two years :)

Here's the coursework you assigned. But, inspired by a YouTube video, I did this all in three (technically two and a half) days! Dropdowns, sounds, GUIs, polishing...

<b>ALL IN THREE, GRUELING DAYS. I'M EXHAUSTED.</b>

For this project, I used a library called [Curses](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html) to make a console interface. Attached to this folder should be a "setup.bat" file, installing all of the coursework's dependencies. It's a buggy library, so expect there to be a few issues from time-to-time.

But, I've interval-tested and terminal-tested this program. All seems to run fine - please tell me if there are any bugs while running it. Would honestly love to know so I can improve for next time.

I decided to be ambitious to hopefully impress you. Almost 1k lines in total. Sorry if I haven't commented it all - did that close to the end of the project.

### Anyways, hoping for another amazing two years with you. See you Wednesday!
